            <h3>Causes of War</h3>
            <p>Wars often arise from a complex interplay of factors. Understanding these causes is crucial for preventing future conflicts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Political Disputes:</strong> Differing ideologies, governance models, and struggles for power can lead to tensions that escalate into armed conflict.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Interests:</strong> Competition over scarce resources, trade routes, and economic advantage often fuels hostilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Injustice:</strong> Marginalization, discrimination, and social inequality can trigger movements that escalate into armed conflict.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural and Religious Differences:</strong> Clashes between different identities and belief systems can lead to misunderstandings and violence.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Connection to SDGs:</strong> Addressing the causes of war aligns with SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and SDG 16.</p>
